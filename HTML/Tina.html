        <h2> Biography and Background</h2>
        <img src="../HTML//Images/download (2).jpeg" />
        <p>
            Tina Magqira was born and raised in Cape Town, where her curiosity and problem-solving nature shaped her from a young age. Inspired by resilience and adaptability, she has always embraced change as an opportunity for growth.

            She began her academic journey at the University of Pretoria (UP), initially enrolling in a BSc in Quantity Surveying. However, within her first year, she realized that the field wasn’t her passion. Determined to pursue something more aligned with her interests, she made the bold decision to switch programs.

            Tina is now studying for a BIT in Information Systems, majoring in Information Science. This shift allowed her to explore her love for technology and problem-solving, opening doors to new opportunities in the digital and business world. Her journey reflects her willingness to take risks and carve out a path that truly excites her.
